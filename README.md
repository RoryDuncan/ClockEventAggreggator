ClockEventAggregator
===============

ClockEventAggreggator is a combination of a tick-driven javascript clock (often seen in game development) and an event aggreggator, allowing events to be set based on specific clock times, loop intervals, and named events. ClockEventAggreggator also contains basic clock functionality like pausing, resuming, and resetting.
